# Welcome!
### Here is something about me

### Data Engineering projects
- [News Crawler - a Scrapy spider that crawls news and run in a Docker Container](https://github.com/icapetti/news-crawler)
- [ANP Crawler - a Scrapy spider that crawls fuel prices](https://github.com/icapetti/anp-crawler)
<br>This crawler extracts data from ANP research on fuels and has two quality layers implemented: 
- Pipeline for data standardization
- Validator and Monitor, using Spidermon, to validate if the data are in the defined structure and typing and monitor the 
  crawler statistics, such as minimum amount of extracted items, unwanted http status, errors, etc.
    
  If any validation and monitoring items encounter issues, an alert is sent to a monitoring channel in Slack.
  The extracted data is saved in a gzip-compressed jsonlines file and sent to an AWS S3 bucket.

### Challenges and tests
- [Melhor Envio - Data Engineering challenge: ETL with Docker](https://github.com/icapetti/challenge-melhor-envio)

### Courses in progress or completed
- [100 days of code: complete Python bootcamp!](https://github.com/icapetti/100-days-of-code-python-bootcamp)
- [Data Engineering How Bootcamp](https://github.com/icapetti/data-engineering-how-bootcamp)

### Various
- [Smart River - System for monitoring the level of rivers](https://github.com/icapetti/tcc_arduino)
<br>My college graduation capstone project: an android app for monitoring the level of rivers. 
The data is collected by sensors that communicate with a central through LoRa wireless technology, present on an Arduino MKR board. 
The central, an ESP8266 board, consolidates the data and sends it to the database via Wi-Fi, which is finally accessed by the android application.

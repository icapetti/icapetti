# Welcome!
### Here is something about me

### Data Engineering projects
#### Crawlers
- [News Crawler - a Scrapy spider that crawls news and run in a Docker Container](https://github.com/icapetti/news-crawler)
<br>Extract textual data relating to news. The output of this crawler is particularly useful for researches with NLP, Computational Linguistics and Analytical intelligence with grouped texts. 
  - Runs on a Docker container
  - The items crawled from the website are saved as jsonlines, compressed with gzip and send to a bucket on AWS.

- [ANP Crawler - a Scrapy spider that crawls fuel prices](https://github.com/icapetti/anp-crawler)
<br>This crawler extracts data from ANP research on fuels and has two quality layers implemented: 
  - Pipeline for data standardization
  - Validator to validate if the data are in the defined structure and typing
  - Monitor for monitoring the crawler statistics, such as minimum amount of extracted items, unwanted http status, errors, etc.
  - Alerts to a Slack channel if one or more monitors failed
  - All this process run in a EC2 instance on AWS
  - Circle CI is used to manage the deploy process from Github to the EC2 instance
    
  The extracted data is saved in a gzip-compressed jsonlines file and sent to an AWS S3 bucket.

### Challenges and tests
- [Melhor Envio - Data Engineering challenge: ETL with Docker](https://github.com/icapetti/challenge-melhor-envio)<br>
This project runs in a Docker container and read a zip file which contains a jsonline data, transforms and load to a MySQL database. 
Then, extract data from this database with sql queries and generate a excel file report.

### Courses in progress or completed
- [Advanced SQL: MySQL Data Analysis & Business Intelligence](https://github.com/icapetti/advanced-mysql-for-analysis-and-bi)
- [100 days of code: complete Python bootcamp!](https://github.com/icapetti/100-days-of-code-python-bootcamp)
- [Data Engineering How Bootcamp](https://github.com/icapetti/data-engineering-how-bootcamp)

### Various
- [Smart River - System for monitoring the level of rivers](https://github.com/icapetti/tcc_arduino)
<br>My college graduation capstone project: an android app for monitoring the level of rivers. 
The data is collected by sensors that communicate with a central through LoRa wireless technology, present on an Arduino MKR board. 
The central, an ESP8266 board, consolidates the data and sends it to the database via Wi-Fi, which is finally accessed by the android application.
